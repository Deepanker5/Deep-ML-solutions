# Deep-ML-solutions
My solutions for problems in the Deep-ML website. They are leetcode-esque problems, except for machine learning
Folder structure: 
 - folders are numbered in a manner where the problems appear when you first open the website. 

Goal:
- Primary goal with these problems is just to get familiar with all of the topics relate to ML e.g. Linear algebra, numpy, deep learning, machine learning, probability and statistics
